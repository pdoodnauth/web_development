        <article>Guyana is a kind of place that's becoming increasingly rare in the world today; come and you'll find untouched nature with amazing wildlife and birding experiences, rich culture and heritage, warm hospitality and a relaxing, Caribbean vibe. 90% of the population live along the coast, leaving the country's lush interior untouched, and ripe for exploration. The thick forests and river systems are home to iconic animals and birds. 820 plus species of birds, 228 species of mammals, 900 species of fish and more than 6500 plants back the country’s reputation have given Guyana its deserved reputation as a serious wildlife and birding destination.

        Travellers often come with extensive checklists when visiting the protected areas and pristine rainforests. Visitors come to Guyana hoping for glimpses of giants such as jaguars, arapaima (the world’s largest-scaled freshwater fish), giant anteaters, harpy eagles, capybaras, giant river otters, black caimans and the world’s largest lily, Victoria Amazonica. Other heart-stoppers include puma, leatherback turtles, bird-eating spiders, several species of monkeys and a host of snakes – bushmasters, anacondas, rattlesnakes, labarias and corals.

                <h2>Kaieteur Falls</h2>
                <p>The water of Kaieteur, one of the world’s natural wonders, flows over a sandstone conglomerate tableland into a deep gorge – a drop of 741 feet or 5 times the height of Niagara Falls.
                    There are no other falls in the world with the magnitude of the sheer drop existing at Kaieteur.  Amerindian legend of the Patamona tribe has it that Kai, one of the tribe’s chiefs (after whom the falls is named), committed self sacrifice by canoeing himself over the falls.  It was believed this would encourage the Great Spirit Makonaima to save the tribe from being destroyed by the savage Caribishi.

                <h2>Georgetown</h2>
                <p>In 1842, the Georgetown Town Council designated the current location of the market on Water Street, officially recognizing it as a market despite the fact that it had served such a capacity for quite some time. The market was designed by an American engineer Nathaniel McKay,and constructed by the Edgemoor Iron Company of Delaware, USA over the period 1880-1881.Construction of the iron and steel structure was completed in 1881 and may be the oldest structure still in use in the city. The market covers an area of about 80,000 square feet (7,000 m2).[4] and houses a wide variety of items for sale.</p>
