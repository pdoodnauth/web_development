                Kaieteur National Park
Guyana South America icon South America
Kaieteur National Park is located on the western side of central Guyana.  The park covers an area of 242 square miles (630 sq km).  It is the country’s only national park protecting nature and wilderness.

The heart of the national park is the renowned Kaieteur Falls, which is also the iconic tourist attraction for the country.  The Potaro River is the source of the falls which flows downstream into the Essequibo River.  The Essequibo River is the longest river in Guyana and one of the most thrilling in South America.

The national park is rich in biodiversity which would be consistent with any protected area connected with the Amazon rainforest.  The vast rivers, expansive savanna, and luscious rainforest are all part of the Guiana Shield ecosystem which is nestled in the highlands of Guyana

Cultural heritage is also prevalent in the park with a number of small tribes of Amerindian people who have lived in the Amazon forest area for thousands of years.  Having an opportunity to see some of these tribes is a taste of history.

The dense jungle of the Amazonian rainforest along with the waterways of the park creates an astounding habitat for amazing wildlife.  Some of the favored species visitors hope to see include the jaguar and giant otter.  South America’s largest butterfly call the park home and the golden rocket frog is endemic to Kaieteur.  One of the most renowned birds of the park is the brilliantly colored Guianan cock-of-the-rock.
